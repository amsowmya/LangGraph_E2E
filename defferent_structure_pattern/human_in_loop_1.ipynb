In an attempt to cope with a plummeting currency, the Zimbabwean government printed a banknote with a denomination of 100 trillion ZWD. At the time, this was only worth about $0.40. Therefore if we equate the estimated $80 trillion that exists in the world today to the extinct Zimbabwean Dollar, the total value of all currency on Earth is [...] Worldwide, M0 is projected at around $5 trillion.

In total, the value of all physical currency comes in around $8–9 trillion. Sounds like a lot, right? Well, here\\'s the kicker: This is actually less than 10% of the total global money supply. Less than 10%! It turns out there’s a whole lot more to money than what you can physically hold in your hands. [...] Money isn\\'t just what you have in your wallet or tucked away in a safe. The global money supply has various layers—starting with physical cash, known as \"M0,\" and then branching out to include everything from checking and savings accounts to institutional funds and less liquid assets.
